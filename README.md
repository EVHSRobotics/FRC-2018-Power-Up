# FRC-2018-Power-Up
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EVHSRobotics/FRC-2018-Power-Up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EVHSRobotics/FRC-2018-Power-Up)
### This is the code base for Team 2854, The Prototypes, code base for FIRST Power Up.

-------
#### See a bug? Open an issue!
Note to team: Please only use your assigned branch. PR will need Code Reviews to be pushed to master. DO NOT mess with other people's branches. Treat your branch as master. You may create additional branches when necessary, but be sure to clean them up afterwards (**AKA DELETE THEM!**).

-------

**Required libraries are in the lib folder. Make sure to put these in `C:\Users\{USER-NAME}\wpilib\user\java\lib\` on Windows or `/Users/{USER-NAME}/wpilib/user/java/lib/` on MacOS, and restart Eclipse! Have a Mac? Follow instructions below.**

-------


If you are using IntelliJ (which I recommend anyway), install the [FRC plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9405-frc) and download WPILib from there. I especially recommend this if you are using a Mac - saves you lots of pain to get setup.

**Don't forget to import project as Eclipse Project if you are using IntelliJ!**

### Current Proposed Goals:
* 3 box auto
    - Fast box recognization using a je vois camera
    - Depth mapping and comparison using stereo vision to find closest box
* Robot avoidance during auto
