#### See a bug? Open an issue!
Note to team: Please only use your assigned branch. PR will need Code Reviews to be pushed to master. DO NOT mess with other people's branches. Treat your branch as master. You may create additional branches when necessary, but be sure to clean them up afterwards (**AKA DELETE THEM!**).

**Required libraries are in the lib folder. Make sure to put these in C:\Users\YOURUSER\wpilib\user\java\lib, and restart Eclipse!**
