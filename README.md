# FRC-2018-Power-Up

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EVHSRobotics/FRC-2018-Power-Up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EVHSRobotics/FRC-2018-Power-Up)

<h2>

This is the code base for Team 2854, The Prototypes, code base for FIRST Power Up

</h2>
<p>
  We moved the repo to our clubs organization. Git will work as it but if you want to avoid confusion, run <br>
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/EVHSRobotics/FRC-2018-Power-Up <br>
  You don't need to do this, but if Git dies this might fix something
 </p>
